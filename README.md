# Truck The Dealer

Pass & Play drinking game for 2-8 players.

Game Rules created by Dave Lombardo.

## Rules

2-8 people can play.

Objective is to get the dealer trucked (fucked) because this is a drinking game.

1. The deck 52 regular playing cards are shuffled.
1. The deck is handed to one person playing (at random) & who did not deal first last game. This person is now the dealer.

Playing the game:
1. The dealer secretly looks at the top card on the deck. The player to the dealer's left must guess the card that the dealer looks at.
1. The guesser verbally announces their guess (e.g. "King", "3", "Ace", etc.).
1. The dealer tells the guesser if their card is higher or lower than the guesser's guess. Or if the guesser is correct, move to step 5.
1. The player then makes a second guess based on the dealer's hint.
1. If the player guesses correctly, everyone shouts 'GOOD ANSWER' and then the dealer must take a drink. If the player guesses incorrect, the dealer tells the player to drink.
1. Regardless of the outcome of the last action, the dealer puts the card in the middle of the table for everyone to see
1. We will repeat step 1-6 with the player to the left of the last guesser guessing. The dealer can never be the guesser. If this ever happens, the dealer is skipped.
1. Step 7 is repeated with the same dealer until the guessers guess wrong 3 times in a row.
1. When multiple cards are revealed to the table, the cards are displayed in a readable order with ace being low and king being high. Cards of different suit are stacked on top until all 4 cards of each type have been dealt. Then these cards are 'turned over' because they have all been dealt.
1. When the guessers have guessed correctly 5 times in a row, the dealer must take a shot.
1.  When the guessers have guessed correctly 7 times in a row, the dealer must take a punishment. The punishment should be able to be configured by player 1/the group leader.
1. The game is over when the deck is finished.
